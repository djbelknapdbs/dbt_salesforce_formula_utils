# Fivetran Salesforce Formula Utils

This package includes macros to be used within a Salesforce dbt project to accurately map Salesforce Formulas to existing tables.

## Installation Instructions
In order to use this macro it is expected that you have set up your own dbt project. If you have not, you can reference the [dbt installation docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) for the latest installation instructions, and then reference [the dbt package docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Macro Instructions
### Installing the Macro Package
This macro is intended to be used within a salesforce dbt project model. To leverage the macro, you will add the below configuration to your `packages.yml` file (if you do not have a `packages.yml` file you can create one).
```yml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/salesforce_formula_utils
    version: [">=0.1.0", "<0.2.0"]
```
> **Note**: In order to use the macros included in this package you will need to have a properly configured source package with a source named `salesforce`. To see an example of a properly configured Salesforce source yml you can reference [integration_tests](integration_tests/models/src_fivetran_formula.yml). You are also welcome to copy/paste this source configuration into your dbt root project and modify for your Salesforce use case.

### Model Creation
Once the package is added, you may use the macro within your salesforce models. To do so you will create a new file in your models folder and name it (`your_table_name_here`_view.sql). Then add the below snippet into the file. You will then update the `your_table_name_here` argument to be the table for which you are generating the model:
```sql
{{ salesforce_formula_utils.sfdc_formula_view('your_source_table_name_here') }}
```

Once you have created all your desired models and copied/modified the sql snippet into each model you will execute `dbt deps` to install the macro package, then execute `dbt run` to generate the models. Additionally, you can reference the [integration_tests](integration_tests/models/) folder for examples on how to use the macro within your models.

### Model Creation Automation
If you have multiple models you need to create, you can also Leverage the [sfdc_formula_model_automation](sfdc_formula_model_automation.sh) script within this project to automatically create models locally via the command line. Below is an example command to copy and edit.

```bash
source dbt_modules/salesforce_formula_utils/sfdc_formula_model_automation.sh "../path/to/directory" "desired_table_1,desired_table_2,desired_table_infinity"
```

## Macro Descriptions
### sfdc_formula_view ([source](macros/sfdc_formula_view.sql))
This macro generates the final sql needed to join the Salesforce formula fields to the desired table.

**Usage:**
```sql
{{ salesforce_formula_utils.sfdc_formula_view(join_to_table_first='fivetran_sfdc_example_table') }}
```
**Args:**
* `join_to_table_first` (required): The table with which you are joining the formula fields.
* `source_name` (optional, default 'salesforce'): The dbt source containing the table you want to join with formula fields. Must also contain the `fivetran_formula` table.
----
### sfdc_formula_pivot ([source](macros/sfdc_formula_pivot.sql))
This macro pivots the dictionary results generated from the [sfdc_fet_formula_column_values](macros/sfdc_fet_formula_column_values.sql) macro to populate the formula field and sql for each record within the designated table this macro is used.

**Usage:**
```sql
{{ salesforce_formula_utils.sfdc_formula_pivot(join_to_table='fivetran_sfdc_example_table') }}
```
**Args:**
* `join_to_table` (required): The table with which you are joining the formula fields.
* `source_name` (optional, default 'salesforce'): The dbt source containing the table you want to join with formula fields. Must also contain the `fivetran_formula` table.
----

### sfdc_get_formula_column_values ([source](macros/sfdc_fet_formula_column_values.sql))
This macro is designed to look within the users source defined `salesforce_schema` for the `fivetran_formula` table. The macro will then filter to only include records from the `join_to_table` argument, and search for distinct combinations of the `field` and `sql` columns. The distinct combination of columns for the join_table argument are then returned as a dictionary.
> Note: This macro will not work accurately unless you have a `src.yml` configured appropriately. For reference, look within this packages [integration_tests](integration_tests/models/fivetran_formula_src.yml) folder for an example of a source configuration.

**Usage:**
```sql
{{ salesforce_formula_utils.sfdc_get_formula_column_values(fivetran_formula='salesforce', key='field', value='sql', join_to_table='fivetran_sfdc_example_table') }}
```
**Args:**
* `fivetran_formula` (required): The source configuration for the `fivetran_formula` table. If this is in a different source than the default `salesforce`, that source will also apply to the `join_to_table` parameter.
* `key` (required): The key column within `fivetran_formula` you are querying. This argument is typically `field`.
* `value` (required): The value column within `fivetran_formula` you are querying. This argument is typically `sql`.
* `join_to_table` (required): The table with which you are joining the formula fields.
----

## Automation Bash Script
### sfdc_formula_model_automation.sh ([source](sfdc_formula_model_automation.sh))
This bash script is intended to be used in order to automatically create the desired salesforce models via the command line within your dbt project. This bash script will generate a model file within your dbt project that contains the `sfdc_formula_view` macro for the appropriately defined table(s). In order for this command to work you must be within the root directory of your dbt project. 

**Usage:**
```bash
source dbt_modules/salesforce_formula_utils/sfdc_formula_model_automation.sh "../path/to/directory" "desired_table(s)"
```

**Example**
Assuming the path to your directory is `"../dbt_salesforce"` and the table(s) you want to generate the model for are `opportunity` and `account`.
```bash
source dbt_modules/salesforce_formula_utils/sfdc_formula_model_automation.sh "../dbt_salesforce" "opportunity,account"
```
